# Letter Recognition Modelling

This project utilises k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and decision tree classifiers on the letter recognition dataset to develop accurate classification models. Letter recognition is a foundational problem in pattern recognition and is widely applicable across a range of real world tasks.

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook and a written report, which justify the modelling choices made and provide a critical discussion of the results obtained.
